# ðŸ“¦ Trained Model Not Included

The trained model file `chest_xray_model.h5` (121MB) is not included in this repository due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit.

ðŸ‘‰ **[Download the trained model from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aBZKDyYIyhTJE4EWAYCu-JDXF2NNhfwz/view?usp=sharing)**

Once downloaded, move the file into the root directory of the project


This allows the model to be loaded during predictions and used with the Gradio app.
